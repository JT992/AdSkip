# AdSkip

This is a simple Chrome(ium) extension that will load on YouTube pages and allow you to skip an ad before the option to skip comes up. Recently, I've found that some adverts will still get around my ad blocker, so I made this extension that will press the "Skip Ad" button while it's still hidden. To activate it, simply press the `S` key on the keyboard.

Note that (for the moment) this still only works on skippable ads. Ads where a Skip Ad button won't appear are still unskippable.

This also only works on YouTube. I may try to cover more websites in the future.
